# OpenStreetMap Toronto Analysis

### Reason for picking
Toronto, the provincial capital of Ontario, Canada, is a large, ethnically diverse city sprawling along Lake Ontario’s northwestern shore. A dynamic metropolis with a core of soaring skyscrapers, all dwarfed by the iconic CN Tower, it also features abundant green spaces, from the orderly oval of Queen’s Park to 400-acre High Park and its trails, sports facilities and zoo.

I chose to look at the OSM data for Toronto because it's my hometown.
